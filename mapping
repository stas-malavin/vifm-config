" Calls the following programs:
" xclip feh gimp mate-terminal audacious caja (Mate desktop)

"%a     User arguments.  When  user  arguments  contain  macros,  they  are expanded before preforming substitution of %a.
"%c %"c The current file under the cursor.
"%C %"C The current file under the cursor in the other directory.
"%f %"f All of the selected files.
"%F %"F All of the selected files in the other directory list.
"%b %"b Same as %f %F.
"%d %"d Full path to current directory.
"%D %"D Full path to other file list directory.
"%rx %"rx  Full paths to files in the register {x}.  In case of invalid symbol in place of {x}, it's processed with  the  rest  of  the  line  and default register is used.
"%m     Show command output in a menu.
"%M     Same  as  %m,  but l (or Enter) key is handled like for :locate and :find commands.
"%S     Show command output in the status bar.
"%s     Execute command in split  window  of  active  terminal  multiplexer (ignored if not running inside one).
"%i     Completely ignore command output.
"Use %% if you need to put a percent sign in your command.
"Note  that  %m,  %M, %s, %S and %i macros are mutually exclusive. Only the last one of them in the command will take effect.

"You can use filename modifiers after %c, %C, %f, %F, %b, %d and %D macros.
"       Supported modifiers are:
"       - :p           - full path
"       - :u            -  UNC name of path (e.g. "\\server" in "\\server\share"), Windows only.  Expands to current computer name for not UNC paths.
"       - :~           - relative to the home directory
"       - :.           - relative to current directory
"       - :h           - head of the filename
"       - :t           - tail of the filename
"       - :r           - root of the filename (without last extension)
"       - :e           - extension of the filename (last one)
"       - :s?pat?sub?  - substitute the first occurrence of pat with sub.  You can use any character for '?', but it must not occur in pat or sub.
"       - :gs?pat?sub? - like :s, but substitutes all occurrences of pat with sub. See  ':h  filename-modifiers'  in  Vim's  documentation for the detailed description. Using %x means expand corresponding macro escaping all  characters  that have  special  meaning.  And %"x means using of double quotes and escape only backslash and double quote characters, which is more useful on Windows systems.
